# Traffic Sign Recognition for Self-Driving Cars

## Overview
This project aims to build a traffic sign recognition model that can be used in self-driving cars to automatically recognize traffic signs. The model uses deep learning techniques to classify traffic signs and alert the driver about the signs around them.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platform**: Google Colab
- **Other**: Python, Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Involved:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Found and loaded a traffic sign dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessed the images, resized them, and normalized them.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed class distribution to check for class imbalance.
4. **Model Development**: Built, compiled, and trained a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Plotted accuracy and loss graphs for model training.
6. **Testing**: Preprocessed test data, made predictions, and visualized the predicted labels.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed to classify various types of traffic signs.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vatsssal/TrafficSignRecognition
